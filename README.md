TnP fitting for egamma analysis

This is my fitting code I used for measuring electron efficiency using
Tag & Probe.

the file "run2.sh" can be used to run "MChistfit.py"

the .sh file itself contains the instructions on how to run it, you
will want to put the name the .C file you're running on

these particular .C files were hand pulled from the files created
using the "tnpEGM_fitter.py" and "run.sh"

(located in the "tnpEGM_fitter" folder)
